‚öôÔ∏è DAX Implementation
Custom DAX queries were written to create calculated columns and measures for advanced analysis:

Customer Segmentation:

Code snippet

// Age Group Segmentation
AgeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 30, "20-30",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 40, "30-40",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 50, "40-50",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60, "50-60",
    "60+"
)
Code snippet

// Income Group Segmentation
IncomeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'public cust_detail'[income] < 35000, "Low",
    'public cust_detail'[income] < 70000, "Med",
    "High"
)
Week-over-Week Revenue Calculation:

Code snippet

// Current Week Revenue
Current_week_Reveneue = CALCULATE(
    SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('public cc_detail'),
        'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2])
    )
)

// Previous Week Revenue
Previous_week_Reveneue = CALCULATE(
    SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('public cc_detail'),
        'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2]) - 1
    )
)
üéØ Project Outcome
The project culminated in a powerful, interactive dashboard that successfully streamlines data processing to monitor key financial metrics. It delivers clear, actionable insights to stakeholders, enhancing their ability to make informed, data-driven decisions for the credit card division.
