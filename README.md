Credit Card Financial Weekly Dashboard
Project Objective
To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

Tools Used

Database: SQL 


Data Visualization & BI: Power BI 


Data Analysis: DAX 


Data Analysis and DAX Queries
Several DAX queries were written to create new measures and calculated columns for in-depth analysis:

Customer Segmentation:


AgeGroup: Customers were categorized into different age brackets (e.g., "20-30", "30-40", "60+") for demographic analysis.



IncomeGroup: Customers were segmented into "Low", "Med", and "High" income tiers based on their income levels.


Financial Metrics:


Revenue: A key metric was created by combining annual_fees, total_trans_amt, and interest_earned.


Current_week_Reveneue: Calculated the sum of revenue for the most recent week in the dataset.



Previous_week_Reveneue: Calculated the sum of revenue for the week prior to the most recent one to enable week-over-week comparisons.


Key Insights from the Dashboard
Week-over-Week (WoW) Change (as of Week 53)
Revenue demonstrated a strong positive trend, increasing by 28.8% compared to the previous week.

Year-to-Date (YTD) Overview

Overall Financials: The total revenue generated year-to-date is $57M , which includes a total transaction amount of $46M and total interest earned of $8M.




Demographic Performance: Male customers are the higher contributors to revenue, generating $31M compared to $26M from female customers.


Product Performance: The Blue and Silver credit card types are the most popular, contributing to 93% of all transactions.


Geographical Insights: A significant portion of business (68%) is concentrated in three states: Texas (TX), New York (NY), and California (CA).

Key Performance Indicators:

The overall customer activation rate is 57.5%.

The overall delinquent rate is 6.06%.

Project Outcome
This project successfully delivered an interactive dashboard using Power BI, fed by customer and transaction data from a SQL database. The solution streamlines data processing and analysis, allowing for efficient monitoring of key performance metrics and trends. Ultimately, the dashboard provides actionable insights that empower stakeholders to make better-informed, data-driven decisions.
